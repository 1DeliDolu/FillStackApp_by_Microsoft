To complete this assignment, you’ll submit your code for a complete and optimized full-stack application, InventoryHub, which you worked on using Microsoft Copilot. The project integrates the work you completed in four previous activities and focuses on:

* Creating seamless communication between the front-end and back-end
* Resolving integration issues
* Structuring JSON responses
* Optimizing performance

This project combines all these activities into a comprehensive submission for review and feedback.

 There are a total of 30 points for this project:

* (5 pts) Did you create a GitHub repository for your project?
* (5 pts) Did you generate and refine integration code for front-end and back-end communication?
* (5 pts) Did you debug and resolve integration issues effectively using Microsoft Copilot?
* (5 pts) Did you create and implement JSON structures for API communication?
* (5 pts) Did you optimize the integration code for performance using Microsoft Copilot?
* (5 pts) Did you include a reflective summary explaining how Copilot assisted in each step?

## Step 1: Make sure previous project parts are complete
